GUI TESTS
For the CargoSystem project, automated GUI tests have been used to
test all the functionalities of the system. Another unit test class
named "ManifestGUITests" has been created using the automated GUI tests, 
which has been supplied as code drop for the assignment 2 part 2, as 
a template in order to provide an evidence showing that the graphical 
interface of the system functions and has been tested successfully.
