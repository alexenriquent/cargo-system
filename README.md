## Managing Cargo on a Container Ship ##

Intermodal freight containers are used to transport manufactured goods all around the world. In this assignment your team will play the role of a small software company which has been commissioned by a major shipping firm to develop a program to help them manage the mixed cargo carried on the decks of their container ships.

The shipping containers are loaded and unloaded via an overhead crane. Before a voyage begins, the ship’s captain decides how much weight the ship can carry, how many stacks of containers there will be on deck, how high the stacks may be, and any other constraints on the loading and unloading of containers. Each container has a unique code to identify it, consistent with international standards.

￼
The ship’s captain needs to monitor loading and unloading activities from the bridge, but the view of activities on the deck is restricted from this vantage point. The program you are required to develop will form part of an automated system which will help the captain see the state of the ship’s cargo, without the need to go down on deck.
